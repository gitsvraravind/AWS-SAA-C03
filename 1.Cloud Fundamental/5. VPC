##### VPC - Foundational Infrastructure Element 
###### 1. Dedicated, logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. 
###### 2. Within this VPC , you have full control over the network architecture , enabling you to design,
######    configure and manage your network resources.
###### 3. AWS VPC is a virtual network that allows you to define your IP address range, create subnets and manage network settings. 
###### 4. It is a gated community within a city. 
######    Each VPC is self contained and has its own rules and regulations. 
######    The AWS resources within each neighborhood can communicate with each other freely but there are gates (security groups and NACLs) controlling who can enter or exit the neighborhood.

#### Key Components of AWS VPCs
###### 1. IP addressing - Define IP address range.You cannot have two houses with the same street name and number.
###### 2. Subnets - Subdivisions with VPC , located on a specific availability zones. Subnets are like streets and each house must have a unique number on the street. 
###### 3. Route tables - dictate traffic flow between subnets and control how traffic is routed within the VPC. It is like a sign post.
###### 4. Security Groups - Virtual firewalls allowing you to manage inbound and outbound traffic
###### 5. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) - Additional layer of network security by acting as packet filters, governing traffic at the subnet levels. 

###### 1. NACLs and Security Groups - Control Flow of Packets using the following methods
###### 1A. Stateful
######     Stateful means that the security control remembers which packets and interactions were allowed past in one direction and allows them back through the other way.
###### 1B. Stateless 
######     Stateless means that the security control has no memory of previous events and therefore a packet that has been let past in one direction will not be let back through unless specifically authorized.

#### Security Groups are stateful and therefore need to create inbound rules to handle these.Outbound rules is automatically authorized with the same criteria.
#### NACLs are stateless and therefore inbound and outbound rules must be created. 

###### SGs act as the first line of defense, allowing customers to meticulously specify which types of traffic are permitted to access their resources.
