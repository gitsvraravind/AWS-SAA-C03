# Internet Gateways
###### 1. Serve as entry and exit points for internet bound traffic withint your VPS.
###### 2. Enable resources in public subnets to connect to the internet gateway. 
###### 3. With internet gateway you resources can access external services based on the internet ensuring seamless connectivity. 

# Network Address translation (NAT) Gateways
###### 1. act as a intermediaries between private subnets and the internet. 
###### 2. Facilitate outbound connections initiated by resources within private subnets while masking their private IP addresses. 
###### 3. Provides a secure way for your resources to access external services without exposing thier internal IP address directly to the internet. 

# Internet Gateways
###### 1. Purpose - Provide direct internet access to resources in public subnets. Enable inbound and outbound internet traffic for these resources.
###### 2. Use Cases - Stateful: Rules are evaluated based on the state of the connection. If you allow inbound traffic from a specific IP, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed. Rules are evaluated independently for each instance.
###### 3. Security - Expose resources in public subnets to the internet, making them accessible from anywhere
###### 4. Traffic Direction - Handle both inbound and outbound traffic, allowing public subnet resources to accept incoming connections and initiate outbound connections

# NAT Gateways
###### 1. Purpose - Allow outbound internet access for resources in private subnets. Block unsolicited inbound traffic
###### 2. Use Case - Used when resources in private subnets need to initiate outbound connections to the internet, for example, software updates or accessing external APIs
###### 3. Security - Enhance security by ensuring that resources in private subnets can communicate with the internet while keeping their private IP addresses hidden from external sources
###### 4. Traffic Direction - Primarily handle outbound traffic initiated by resources in private subnets

# Route Gateways
###### 1. Directs Network Traffic.
###### 2. Gain precise control over how traffic flows within your VPC.
###### 3. Define rules to route traffic locally within the VPC or direct it to internet gateway for external access or even send it to other VPCs through VPC peering connections.

# Virtual Private Network Connections
###### 1. Establish secure connections links.
###### 2. Encrypted tunnels allow data to traverse between your VPC and on premises data center or remote offices. 

#### Several Types of VPN
#### AWS Direct Connect 
###### 1. Dedicated, Private Network connections.
###### 2. Offers high speed , low latency connections for mission critical workloads.

#### AWS Site-Site VPN
###### 1. Create encrypted VPN connections.
###### 2. enables secure communication between your data center and AWS resources over the internet. 

#### AWS Clinet VPN
###### 1. Managed VPN Service
###### 2. Enables remote users to securely access AWS resources and on-premises networks from anywere using OpenVPN.

#### AWS Private Link 
###### 1. Allows access to AWS services over a private connection without using Public IPs.
###### 2. Secure and efficient way to connect to AWS services. 
###### 3. Want to access AWS services over  a private connection without exposing your data to the public internet. 

#### AWS transit Gateway 
###### 1. acts as a hub connects multiple AWS VPCs, VPN connections and Direct Connect Gateways.
###### 2. Useful when we have a laarge number of VPCs and need to manage the data flow between them.
###### 3. The main advantage of AWS Transit Gateway is its ability to consolidate and manage the interconnectivity of multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub

#### AWS VPN Cloud Hub
###### 1. Designed for companies with multiple remote branmch office or partner networks that need to connect to multiple AWS VPCs via a centralized hub and spoke network design. 

# VPC Peerring
###### 1. Establishing connections between multiple VPCs.
###### 2. Imagine your organization maintains separate VPCs for development, testing, and production environments. VPC peering allows data sharing and communication while keeping these environments logically isolated, facilitating efficient development and testing before deployment to production.
