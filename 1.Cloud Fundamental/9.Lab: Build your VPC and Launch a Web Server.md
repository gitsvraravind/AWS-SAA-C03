3. In the IPV4 CIDR - Enter the IP 10.0.0.0/16
4. Rest are all default 
5. Click on Create VPC
6. Click on *Your VPCs* and the VPC is created successfully

#### Subnet Creation > Public and Private
#### Create a Public Subnet
1. Click on Subnets
2. Click on Create Subnets
3. From the VPC Drop Down - Select the VPC Created > MYLABVPC
4. Provide a Subnet Name - MyPublicSubnet
5. Select Availability Zone as US East - us-east-1a (Depends on your zone where you are creating)
6. In the IPV4 VPC CIDR Block - Enter the IP 10.0.0.0/24
7. Refer the Link for CIDR Calculation > https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html
8. The Line 1 > 2nd Column > Represent the subnet provided as in step 6. The CIDR notation will be 24. Refer the CIDR Notation block in the webpage.
9. Click on Create. The public subnet is created.

10. #### Create a Private Subnet
11. Steps are the same as above. Only the Name and Subnet will differ.
12. Click on Create Subnet
13. From the VPC Drop Down - Select the VPC Created > MYLABVPC
14. Provide a Subnet Name - MyPrivateSubnet
15. Select Availability Zone as US East - us-east-1a (Depends on your zone where you are creating)
16. Refer the Link for CIDR Calculation > https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html
17. In the IPV4 VPC CIDR Block - Enter the IP 10.0.1.0/24
18. The Line 2 > 2nd Column > Represent the subnet provided as in step 17. The CIDR notation will be 24. Refer the CIDR Notation block in the webpage.
19. Click on Create Subnet
20. Navigate to "Your VPCs" and the custom subnets created is available ? Public and Private.

##### Now we are going to create a NAT Gateway and it is going to allow the private subnet to reach out to the internet.

21. Click on NatGateWay
22. Click on Create NAT Gateway
23. Provide a Name > MYPRIVATENATGATEWAY
24. Select the subnet > MyOrivateSubnet from the Drop Down
25. Connectivity Type will be Public
26. In the Elastic IP Allocation - Click on Allocate Elastic IP
27. Elastic IP is assigned
28. Click on Create NAT Gateway
29. NAT Gateway Created Successfully for your Private EC2 Instance

#### Create two more subnets 

30. Click on create subnet
31. From the VPC Drop Down - Select the VPC Created > MYLABVPC
32. Provide a Name > MyPublicSubnet2
33. Select a different availability zone > us-east-1b
34. Refer the Link for CIDR Calculation > https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html
17. In the IPV4 VPC CIDR Block - Enter the IP 10.0.2.0/24
18. Click on Create Subnet
    
20. Click on create subnet
31. From the VPC Drop Down - Select the VPC Created > MYLABVPC
32. Provide a Name > MyPrivateSubnet2
33. Select a different availability zone > us-east-1b
34. Refer the Link for CIDR Calculation > https://www.site24x7.com/tools/ipv4-subnetcalculator.html
35. In the IPV4 VPC CIDR Block - Enter the IP 10.0.3.0/24
36. Click on Create Subnet

37. Click on the column IPV4 CIDR and it will get sorted.
38. You will find four subnets created ending with 0,1,2,3/24.

#### Route Tables

39. Navigate to Route Table
40. In the Column - VPC -  You will find MYLABVPC which was created earlier.
41. Click on the Check Box and in the below windows frame click on *Routes* and you will find the route table.
