#### Compute  - Ability to process and execute tasks using virtual servers and services.
#### Traditional virtual servers - EC2

#### Virtual Machines
###### 1. VMs are isolated environments
###### 2. Encapsulate an entire OS Stack including the kernel, libraries and binaries and allocate dedicated resources from the host machine.
###### 3. Each VM requires its own OS.
###### 4. Strong isolation between applications but may suffer from performance overhead due to emulation of hardware and the duplication of OS resources.

#### Containers
###### 1. Lighweight, portable and self sufficient runtime environment that packages an application and dependencies togather. 
###### 2. No need for separate OS installation, they share the host OS kernel and runtime libraries allowing them to run in isolated user-space environments.
###### 3. A layered file system organizes data in layers, where each layer builds upon the previous one, allowing for modularity, easier updates, and the ability to roll back changes without affecting the entire system. 
###### 4. Containers provide fast startup times, efficient resource utilization, and scalability, making them ideal for microservices architectures, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and cloud-native applications.

# AWS Compute Options
