#### Deployment Models 
###### 1) Private Cloud
A cloud computing environment dedicated exclusively to a single organization, providing enhanced control, security, and customization.
Example: A bank using its own data centers to host applications and store sensitive customer data securely.

###### 2) Community Cloud
A cloud infrastructure shared by multiple organizations with similar requirements or objectives, managed either by the organizations or a third party.
Example: A group of healthcare providers sharing a cloud platform to store and access patient records while complying with HIPAA regulations.

###### 3) Public Cloud
A cloud service offered to multiple customers over the internet, owned and operated by third-party providers, making it cost-effective and scalable.
Example: A startup using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host its website and applications.

###### 4) Hybrid Cloud
A computing environment that combines private and public clouds, enabling data and applications to move between them for greater flexibility and optimization.
Example: A company hosting sensitive financial data on a private cloud but running analytics on a public cloud like AWS.
